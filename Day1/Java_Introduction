Java - computer Language which helps develop software and applications.

It is recognized for its robustness, ease of use and strong security features.

Apart from just a programming language, it includes various tools that enable software to operate across different computers and devices. And because of this capability, we refer to java as a "platform".

This platform consists of the Java Runtime Environment(JRE) and Application Programming Interface(API), which work together to help developers create and run applications consistently on multiple applications.

Back in 1995, a group at Sun Microsystems, which is now part of Oracle, made Java. They named it Oak at first, but then changed it to Java because there was already a company named Oak.
